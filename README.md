# Adult_income_prediction


The prominent inequality of wealth and income is  a huge concern in the United States. The principle of universal moral equality ensures sustainable development and improve the economic stability of a nation.
In this project, our work aim is to analyse and predict whether a person's income of U.S is above 50K dollars per year or below above 50K dollars per year based on several attributes from the census data. The Adult Census Income data was extracted from 1994 US Census database  by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker. The dataset contains  features about the people and the labels which we have to predict and the labels are discrete and binary, So the problem is a Supervised Classification type.
This study  shows the usage of machine learning and data mining technique that provide a solution to the income equality problem. The adult census dataset has been used for this purpose.

Introduction :- 
The US Adult Income Dataset  is a dataset that is widely used in tutorial-based machine learning tasks. The classical approach is to use the dataset to train a model and predict the income based on the several attributes and features. 
The Adult Census Income data was extracted from 1994 US Census database . The dataset contains 32561 records with various attributes such as occupation, age, income and so on. Exploratory data analysis will be done between dependent and independent variables and various insights are concluded from EDA.
